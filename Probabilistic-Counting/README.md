# Probabilistic-Counting
### Some Algoithms to Count Unique Elements.

- The project is assignment for master course Advances in Data Mining and it is based on probabilistic methods of counting distinct elements from different hash. 

- Scripts: LogLog_Counting Algorithms , Probabilistic_Counting Algorithm and Trailing_Zeros Algorithm

- Data was generated randomly simulating the result of a hash function, so they are binary bitstreams uniformly distributed.

- Read ||"advances-data-mining.pdf"|| for further information.

### Future work: 
- Hyper_LogLog Algorithm --> [Hyperloglog: The analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf) .

- LogLog-Beta --> [LogLog-Beta and More: A New Algorithm for Cardinality Estimation Based on LogLog Counting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02284) .
